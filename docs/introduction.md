# Introduction #

OMDL uses XML documents to represent mashups, including the workspace, layouts, and included apps, at different stages of the design process.

At the _conceptual_ level, OMDL can be used to describe the overall purpose of a mashup, for example as a set of user requirements.

At the _logical_ level, OMDL can be used to describe a general mashup structure, including the type of apps to be used.

At the _physical_ level, OMDL is used to exchange the implementation of a mashup, including specific apps, layouts and theming.

## Namespace

All OMDL documents use the namespace http://omdl.org

## General Structure

The description, the syntax and structure definition as well as an example of the OMDL at each design level - conceptual, logical, physical - are provided in this section.

### Conceptual level OMDL

During the conceptual design, the workspace will be defined. A bunch of metadata will  describe the workspace semantically. The conceptual design features an abstract notation of the user goals of a workspace. Its aim is the support of unskilled users. A developer is able to talk with them and both sides act on the same foundation. This approach is designed to provide transparency and avoid misunderstandings between users and developers. An example is a meeting of a company where a project manager, who acts for 
and on behalf of developers, talks with the management. The company management normally does not have a deep understanding and interest in technical details. They just want to discuss the overall purpose of such a workspace and get an overview of the embedded 
features and its goals, that is, they want to understand the concept.

### Logical level OMDL
	
In the logical design phase, the user goals of the conceptual design will be evaluated and replaced by abstract app definitions. It is closely related to the conceptual design but both phases are independent of each other. The logical design document is an 
intermediate step between an abstract description of the workspace and a  composed one with apps and additional settings. It includes abstract definitions of apps and rules that have to match during runtime. Legal constraints are taken into account as well as several other restrictions, like a time-based or region-based access policy. This phase leads to a quick overview which app types apply and allows easily to change it. The user does not need a deep understanding of the technical details or programming skills. Its aim is to create an initial set-up of used app types to achieve the desired functionality. The logical design 
could be an intermediate format that is not displayed to the user.

### Physical level OMDL
	
While in the conceptual and logical design phase no real implementation was considered, the physical design is the only phase 
that is directly related to the runtime environment. The workspace is created for the runtime, i.e., all abstract definitions 
of the logical design will be replaced, e.g., with apps, which are available in the app repository. Furthermore, the 
rules of the physical design are transformed into executable ones; these are based on JavaScript objects which have to be 
evaluated a suitable platform during runtime. All specified elements have to be interprete by the runtime environment.
Additionally, styling information for the whole workspace and app specific ones can be set. These are split into layout, 
theme and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) statements.
