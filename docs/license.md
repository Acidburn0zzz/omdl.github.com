# Licensing #

The specifications produced by the OMDL community are made available under the terms of the Open Web Foundation 1.0 Agreement. The signed agreements are available [here](https://github.com/omdl/legal).

## Signing the CLA and OWFa##

Any individual or company that intends to contribute to any of the OMDL specifications is encouraged to sign and submit an OWF Contributor License Agreement. This indicates the signer's voluntary support for the development and publication of the specification.

Once a final specification is ready to be published, contributors and supporters of the specification will be asked to sign an OWFa to formalize their copyright licenses and patent promises to the entire specification.

To submit a CLA for the OMDL specification, [download](http://www.openwebfoundation.org/legal/the-owf-1-0-agreements/owf-contributor-license-agreement-1-0---copyright) the appropriate form, sign, and scan as a PDF. Then send it to the OMDL Google Group list.
